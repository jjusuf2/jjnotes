# Welcome

On this website, you will find my notes on computational biology and biophysics concepts, mostly relating to 3D genome organization.
This website was built using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.io/).

Visit the [Hansen Lab website](https://www.ashansenlab.com/) for more information about my lab's research.
